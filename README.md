## Running the Application
```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
uv run fastapi dev main.py
```


Frontend (UI) is generated by ChatGPT and I think it has done a great job.

I got stuck in merge_intervals logic, so I asked ChatGPT to help me with it. It provided a solution that I found satisfactory.


If I had more time, I would add persistent storage, input validation, custom error messages, user logins, admin login, tests, more user friendly UI.
